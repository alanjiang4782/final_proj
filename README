README: 
1.	First, I uploaded my database to the github repo because the runtime of generating the database takes around 40 minutes on my computer because I’m scraping around 2000 webpages. If you wish to test the generation of database, run the file ‘final_proj.py’ to generate the database used, the data presentation and interaction phase does not require web access and scraping. The database file must be present before the data presentation and interaction codes can be run. 
2.	Second, run the file ‘supermovie_flask.py’ to test the interaction and presentation of data. It will direct you to a webpage where the options following it are quite intuitive. On the first page, select your options according to your interest and click ‘go!’. It will direct you to the second page where you can see a list of movies that matches your search. From there, you can copy the name of one of the movies that interests you and paste it to the bottom where it asks for user input. After clicking ‘go!’ again, it will direct you to the page where detailed information of the movie are presented. If any of the casts interests you, you can copy the name of the person and paste it to the place where it asks you to input a cast name. After clicking ‘go!’ again, you will be able to see the detailed information of that specific cast.
3.  Required packages: flask, sqlite3, plotly, re, bs4, requests, json
